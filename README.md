# GeneticAlgorithmSample
Genetic-algorithm-based solver for maximum-distance-between-two points problem based on GeneticSharp in Wpf

maximum-distance-between-two points problem:
the problem of finding the line of the longest length that fits wholly within a rectangle.
GeneticSharp:
C# Genetic Algorithm library (https://github.com/giacomelli/GeneticSharp).
Program:
Graphically displays the trial solutions and final solution to the problem utilising MVVM based approach in Wpf.
